# Data-Stuctures-Projects
This contains my projects from the CIT360 Data Structures class at Penn College.
Included are several projects, the most notable of which are:

Mock Data Packet Handler - This program uses several threads to simulate data packets being sent and recieved. The packets are stored in a link list until they are processed. A reentrant lock is used to ensure that the program threads do not interfere with one another. 

Maze Generator and Solver - This program procedurally generates a maze and uses both a breadth-first search and a depth-first search to find possible paths between two given points inside the maze. 

Expression Evaluator - This program consists of two algorithms that make use of the stack data structure to process expressions read from text files. The first algorithm verifies that an expression has the correct syntax of parenthesis, brackets, and braces. The second algorithm evaluates postfix expressions.
